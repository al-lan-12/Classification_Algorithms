# Classification_Algorithms

Logistic_Regression :Here the logistic regression is used to predict wheather the student would get admission using the data set Admission.csv which contains the mark, gpa and experience information with the accuracy of 75%

K_Nearest_Neighbours_Algorithm : Here we are using custom dataset to predict if it would be possible to play according to the weather and temperature 

Decesion_Tree_Algorithm : Here we are using the Diabetes.csv to predict if the patient has diabetes according to the input value like insulin,etc using Decesion tree algorithm which gives the accuracy of almost 73%

Support_Vector_Machine : Here we are using the Diabetes.csv to predict if the patient has diabetes according to the input value like insulin,etc using Support Vector Machine algorithm which gives the accuracy of almost 80% which is better than decision tree algorithm
